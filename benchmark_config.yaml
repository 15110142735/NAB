# The data/ directory is subdivided into different groups of datasets which
# you may want to run independently. You may specify any combination of
# those groups here and run_benchmark.py will automatically use those datasets.
DataGroups:
    - artificialWithAnomaly
    - artificialNoAnomaly
    - realAWSCloudwatch
    - realKnownCause

# We provide two anomaly detectors. You may want to use one or both of them
# to generate results. You may also create your own detector as a subclass of
# AnomalyDetector and then add it here to have run_benchmark.py use your
# detector to generate results.
AnomalyDetectors:
    - numenta
    - skyline

ResultsDirectory: "results"

# The probationary period is the number of records at the begining of each
# dataset for which a detector will not be scored. This period is allowed
# to provide a consistent amount of time for each detector to stabilize
# and collect initial statistics. Best not to modify.
ProbationaryPeriod: 600
